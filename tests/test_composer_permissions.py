"""Tests for ConversationsPanel._apply_composer_permissions().

Opening a channel, or a group with "only admins can send messages" on while
the user is not an admin, disables the composer's send/record/attach buttons.
The emoji button was left out of that switch: it stayed clickable in a group
the user cannot post in, opening the picker and inserting text into a field
that had just been made read-only.

The switch also only ever ran when a conversation was *opened*, and
navigate_to_conversation() early-returns for the one already on screen — so a
group switched to announcement-only while the user sat in it kept a writable
message field, with nothing spoken. refresh_composer_permissions() is the
re-entry point for that, and its tests live here too.

What it says when it does is a third defect pinned here: it announced "Agora
somente admins podem enviar mensagens neste grupo" for every writable →
read-only move, including the first time a verdict ever landed for a group
that had been announcement-only for months. Nothing had changed there except
what WinZapp knew, so "agora" was simply false.

ConversationsPanel is a wx.Panel and cannot be instantiated without a running
wx.App, so the method under test is bound to a small stub carrying only the
widgets it touches — same approach as tests/test_conversation_name_update.py.
